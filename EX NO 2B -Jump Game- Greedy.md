# EX 2B Jump Game using Greedy Algorithm.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
You are given an array of integers. Each number represents the maximum number of steps you can jump forward from that position.

You start from the first element (index 0). 
Write a program to find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index of the array.

If it is not possible to reach the end, return -1.
