## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j such that |nums[i] - nums[j]| == k.

The value of |x| is defined as:

x if x >= 0.
-x if x < 0.You're given N jobs, each with:

A unique jobId

A deadline (by which it must be completed)

A profit (earned only if completed on or before the deadline)

Each job:

Takes exactly 1 unit of time

Only one job can be done at a time

Your goal is to maximize total profit while completing the maximum number of jobs possible within their deadlines.
