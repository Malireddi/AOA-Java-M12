# EX 2D Pattern Matching using Naive Approach.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Given text string with length n and a pattern with length m, the task is to prints all occurrences of pattern in text.
Note: You may assume that n > m.

Examples: 

Input:  text = "THIS IS A TEST TEXT", pattern = "TEST"
Output: Pattern found at index 10

Input:  text =  "AABAACAADAABAABA", pattern = "AABA"
Output: Pattern found at index 0, Pattern found at index 9, Pattern found at index 12
